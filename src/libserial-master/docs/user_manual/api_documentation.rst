API Documentation
=================

The API documentation generated by doxygen is available `here
<http://libserial.sourceforge.net/doxygen>`_.

To generate a new set of docs using Sphinx, simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

   sphinx-build -b html docs/user_manual/ docs/html/

The Sphinx output will be located in the */libserial/docs/html/* directory.

To generate a new set of doxygen documentation, you can run the compile.sh script or simply invoke doxygen directly:

.. code-block:: bash

   doxygen doxygen.conf.in

The doxygen output will be located in the */libserial/build/docs/html/* directory.
