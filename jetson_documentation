go to ipv4
for connecting 2 devices netmask and gateway must be same for connecting devices

if gateway is 192.168.1.1 and netmask is 255.255.255.0 when we bitwise and both we will get 192.168.1.0 i.e network 192.168.1.0  can have 255 devices of Address 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255


jetsons ip address -- 192.168.1.233
jetson netmask - 255.255.255.0
jetson default gateway - 192.168.1.1

netmask and gateway of our connecting device and jetson must be same

to get it  --
nmap 192.168.1* 
we get devices in our network 

Our ip address must be 192.168.1.xxx 

jetson netmask - 255.255.255.0

jetson password -- varuna

ssh varuna@192.168.1.233 -- to access jetson ls

scp -r varuna@192.168.1.233:~/* ./ 

-r -- recursively

from varuna@192.168.1.233 - rewuired folder (./ present folder)

it is static ip
